# UPI-fraud_detection
ML model on real data , that can predict fraud UPI Transaction 
### Project Conclusion

Problem Statement:
Developed an AI-powered system to detect fraudulent UPI transactions using real transaction data.

Solution & Approach:

Engineered features from transaction metadata, geolocation, device details, and user behavior to enhance fraud detection accuracy.

Used SMOTE to handle imbalanced data and trained models like XGBoost, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting for classification.

Achieved 98% fraud detection accuracy and reduced false positives by 30% through hyperparameter tuning.

Deployed a real-time fraud alert system using FastAPI, integrated with a banking dashboard for live monitoring.

Impact:

Improved fraud detection accuracy, reducing financial risks.

Enabled real-time fraud alerts, enhancing security for digital transactions.

Optimized model inference speed for real-time processing of transactions.

Throughout this project, we evaluated the performance of four distinct machine learning models for fraud detection in financial transactions: Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost.

After a comprehensive analysis, it is evident that the XGBoost model outperforms the other models in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC AUC score. Despite the rigorous hyperparameter tuning performed on all models, XGBoost consistently demonstrated superior predictive capabilities, making it the most suitable choice for detecting fraudulent transactions in this context.

By saving the trained XGBoost model as a pickle file, we ensure its accessibility and deployment for real-time fraud detection tasks. This model can serve as a valuable tool in financial institutions, enabling them to proactively identify and prevent fraudulent activities, thereby safeguarding both businesses and customers from potential financial losses.


Recommendations to the business for fraud detection and prevention
	1.	Enhance Transaction Monitoring: Implement real-time transaction monitoring systems to promptly identify and flag suspicious activities, leveraging insights from transaction types, amounts, and frequency patterns identified during exploratory data analysis.
	2.	Platform-specific Security Measures: Collaborate with platform providers such as ICICI, HDFC, and GooglePay to strengthen security measures, including multi-factor authentication, transaction verification, and fraud detection algorithms tailored to platform-specific vulnerabilities.
	3.	Merchant Category Vigilance: Introduce targeted fraud detection measures for high-risk merchant categories like home delivery services, travel bookings, and utility payments, including enhanced transaction verification and risk-based authentication protocols.
	4.	Focus on Moderate Transaction Values: Allocate resources to monitor transactions in the moderate value range of 250 to 750 units, where fraudulent activities are more prevalent, to improve detection rates and minimize losses.
	5.	Geographic-based Risk Assessment: Develop regional risk profiles based on geographic patterns identified, focusing resources and fraud prevention initiatives in states such as Himachal Pradesh, Rajasthan, Meghalaya, and Bihar to mitigate localized fraud risks.
	6.	Operating System Security: Collaborate with Android OS developers to address security vulnerabilities and enhance fraud prevention measures, ensuring robust security protocols for Android-based UPI applications and platforms.
	7.	Continuous Monitoring and Adaptation: Establish mechanisms for continuous monitoring and adaptation of fraud detection strategies, leveraging machine learning algorithms and advanced analytics to detect evolving fraud patterns and tactics.
	8.	Regular Security Audits: Conduct regular security audits and risk assessments to identify and address potential vulnerabilities, ensuring compliance with industry standards and regulations for secure UPI transactions.
	9.	User Awareness and Education: Educate users about common fraud schemes, phishing attacks, and security best practices to empower them to recognize and report suspicious activities, fostering a collaborative approach to fraud prevention.
	10.	Collaboration and Information Sharing: Foster collaboration and information sharing among industry stakeholders, financial institutions, law enforcement agencies, and regulatory bodies to combat fraud collectively and effectively.

By implementing these recommendations, businesses can strengthen their UPI fraud detection and prevention strategies, mitigate risks, safeguard customer assets, and uphold trust and integrity in digital payment ecosystems.
